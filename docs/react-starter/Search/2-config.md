# Config

The Search Config (`/search.config.ts`) is an object-like interface for defining search parameters. The `facets`, `listings`, and `minilist` objects provide the configurations for the `useFacets`, `useListing`, and `useMinilist` hooks to query.

Every search object follows the same pattern and there is full TypeScript support available.
