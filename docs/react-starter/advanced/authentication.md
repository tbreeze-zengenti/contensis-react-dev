# Authentication

CRB affords two forms of Authentication:

- Contensis-based
- Azure-based SSO (WSFED)

:::tip
The latest version of Contensis React Base is recommended whenever configuring a project for any form of authorised routing. 
:::

## Contensis-based login

Contensis-based authentication allows users to log in using their Contensis accounts. This approach requires a custom login page, and using React hooks from Contensis React Base helps simplify the implementation. When a user accesses a protected route, they are redirected to this login page. After successful authentication, they‚Äôre automatically returned to their original destination.

### Define Authorised Groups

Access control is based on group membership. Define which groups are allowed access to protected routes.

- Group **name** and **ID** can be found in:
    
    *Contensis ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Groups*
    
- Group **ID** is in the URL of the group settings page.

```tsx
export const authorisedGroups = [
  {
    name: 'Group Name',
    id: 'uuid',
  },
];
```

### Define protected routes

Use `requireLogin` to restrict access to specific routes.

- Supports both `staticRoutes` and `contentTypeRoutes`.
- You can assign different groups to different routes.

```tsx
  {
    path: '/',
		...
    requireLogin: authorisedGroups,
  },
```

### Setup login page

To enable login functionality, a login page must be created. This page should include a form that triggers the `useLogin` hook upon submission. The hook's response will provide the current authentication status and handle the login process.

This example shows the **basic setup** for getting a login page working. It does **not** cover error handling or validation states, but these can be added later for a more robust implementation.

```tsx title="Sample login.tsx page"
import React, { FormEvent } from 'react';
import { useLogin } from '@zengenti/contensis-react-base/user';

/**
 * A React functional component that renders a login form.
 * - If the user is not authenticated, it displays a form with fields for username and password.
 * - If the user is authenticated, it displays a message showing the logged-in user's email.
 */
const Login = () => {
  /**
   * Uses the `useLogin` hook to manage authentication state and actions.
   */
  const { isAuthenticated, loginUser, user } = useLogin();

  /**
   * Handles the form submission event, preventing the default behavior and extracting
   * the username and password values from the form. It then calls the `loginUser` function
   * with the extracted credentials.
   */
  const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const form = event.target as HTMLFormElement;
    const username = (form.elements.namedItem('username') as HTMLInputElement)
      .value;
    const password = (form.elements.namedItem('password') as HTMLInputElement)
      .value;
    loginUser(username, password);
  };

  return (
    <div className="login-form">
      {!isAuthenticated ? (
        <>
          <h1>Login</h1>
          <form onSubmit={e => handleSubmit(e)}>
            <div>
              <label htmlFor="username">Username:</label>
              <input type="text" id="username" required />
            </div>
            <div>
              <label htmlFor="password">Password:</label>
              <input type="password" id="password" required />
            </div>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        </>
      ) : (
        <p>
          Logged in as <strong>{user?.email}</strong>
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Login;
```

### Define the Login Route

Once the login page is created, you need to define a route for it. By default, CRB (Contensis React Base) uses the `/account/login` path for login pages. To ensure the page is accessible, you should define this route in your application's routing configuration.

```tsx title="A static route for the login"
{
	path: '/account/login',
	component: Login,
}
```

<aside>

:::tip
You can access detailed information about the authentication state and the currently authenticated user from the **user state** within the Redux store.

### Setup error page

Ensure your app can handle failed logins or unauthorized access.

The system will automatically redirect unauthenticated users or users lacking permissions to an **Access Denied** page.

You must define this route in your routing configuration and ensure the node and renderer is in place for Blocks-based sites.

```tsx title="A static route for the access denied page"
{
	path: '/account/access-denied',
	component: myErrorPage,
}
```

## Azure-based SSO (WSFED)

WS-Federation (WSFED) enables seamless authentication via Azure Active Directory without a custom login page. When a user accesses a protected route, they are redirected to the Azure SSO login portal. Upon successful authentication, they‚Äôre sent back to the original route.

### Configure environment variables

To enable WSFED login, set the following environment variable:

```bash
WSFED_LOGIN=TRUE
```

Ensure the variable is included in `define-config.js`, which exposes these values to your application.

```tsx
const {
  ...
  WSFED_LOGIN,
} = process.env;

/** Optionally the values can be set for development/production respectively
	* WSFED_LOGIN: boolean;
	*/
const development = {
  WSFED_LOGIN,
  ...
};

const production = {
	WSFED_LOGIN,
	...
};
```

**Note**: Any change to `.env` or `define-config.js` requires restarting the app.

### Define Authorised Groups

Access control is based on group membership. Define which groups are allowed access to protected routes.

- Group **name** and **ID** can be found in:
    
    *Contensis ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Groups*
    
- Group **ID** is in the URL of the group settings page.

```tsx
export const authorisedGroups = [
  {
    name: 'Group Name',
    id: 'uuid',
  },
];

```

### Define protected routes

Use `requireLogin` to restrict access to specific routes.

- Supports both `staticRoutes` and `contentTypeRoutes`.
- You can assign different groups to different routes.

```tsx
  {
    path: '/',
		...
    requireLogin: authorisedGroups,
  },
```

## Legacy project considerations

Old CRB based projects may include reference to `oidc`, it‚Äôs important to remove these package references when working with CRB 3.1+:

- Look for `oidc` or `oidc-client` usage.
- These should **not** be listed under Webpack `externals`.
- They also should **not** be installed via your `package.json`. It‚Äôs okay if they exist in `package-lock.json`.

Check your Webpack config:

```tsx
module.exports = {
	...
	externals: ['oidc-client'], // ‚ùå Remove this if present
}
```
