# Local Development

To begin developing locally you'll need to familiarise yourself with these commands:

- `npm start` - start the application in development mode (http://localhost:3000/)
- `npm run storybook` - start storybook in development mode (http://localhost:6006/)
- `npm run build` - build the application into production-ready client and server-side bundles
- `npm run server` - start the application server same as we would as if it were deployed in production (http://localhost:3001/)
- `npm run build:server` - build the application and start the server-side application from source code (allowing us to connect a debugger and stop on code that is executed server-side) (http://localhost:3001/)
