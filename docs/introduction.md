# Introduction

Contensis offers a well-defined API to interact with and retrieve content easily. This API-first approach aligns well with React's component-based structure, enabling developers to integrate content seamlessly into their React applications. 

To compliment this we, Zengenti, have a custom stack for developing applications with Contensis and React. Contensis React Base (CRB) is the foundation of this stack. It's designed to bootstrap React development with Contensis and offers a variety of features out of the box, such as an implementation of Elastic Search.

CRB should be considered a framework for working with React and Contensis, it provides no options for outputting a working application. For that purpose we have our React Starter project. The Starter project is a React application which relies on CRB as a dependency and allows us to develop projects quickly and efficiently.
